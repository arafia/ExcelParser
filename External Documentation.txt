The code currently can read data from spreadsheet and store the values having tag <code> in one array and it's corresponding 
question in another array, both having same index value. Mysteriously, Regex is not working in the dataset you have given to
me but it works on any data made by me on spreadsheet which looks same as the data you have provided. I do not have dense knowledge
on Regex. I will learn about Regex and will try to figure out why REgex is not working on your data.
